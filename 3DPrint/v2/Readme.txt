F2TTL_v2_ForIpad contains 2 parts to print, and 1 model of the board. The two parts press together to form a clip that gently mounts the sensor to the bottom edge of an Ipad screen (Adafruit Part# 1751). The first part must be slightly bent to insert the circuit board. Then, the first part presses into the second part.
